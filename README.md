# lerna-semantic-release

[semantic-release](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semantic-release) for [lerna](http://lernajs.io)-based projects.

Basically a semantic-release that orders commits based on which package they belong to (uses data from [cz-lerna-changelog](https://github.com/atlassian/cz-lerna-changelog)) and then determines on that what the next release should be.
